We have proposed a malware detection module based on advanced data mining and machine learning. While such a method may not be suitable for home users, being very processor heavy, this can be implemented at enterprise gateway level to act as a central antivirus engine to supplement antiviruses present on end user computers. This will not only easily detect known viruses, but act as a knowledge that will detect newer forms of harmful files. While a costly model requires costly infrastructure, it can help in protecting invaluable enterprise data from security threats, and prevent immense financial damage.
